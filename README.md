# Artificial Intelligence master
In this repository there are many notebooks and exercises that I did to prepare for practical exams in the master degree in Artificial Intelligence.

## algorithms
### module 2: Logic and Logic Programming with prolog
Done prolog exercises from past exams and from exercitations

## fundamentals of AI and KR
### module 2: Knowledge Representations
More prolog exercises from [https://www.ic.unicamp.br/~meidanis/courses/mc336/2009s2/prolog/problemas/](this website), and representation of a family knowledge base.
### module 3: Probabilistic Programming
Done exercise on soccer teams from Russel & Norvig book

## Statistical and Mathematical methods for AI
#### homework 1
Floating point arithmetic, and solutions to linear systems 
#### homework 2
Implementation of two mathematical clustering algorithms:
- principal components analysis (PCA)
- linear discriminant analysis (LDA)
#### homework 3
Implementation of two optimization techniques:
- Gradient Descent
- Stochastic Gradient Descent
#### homework 4
Maximum likelihood estimation and Maximum a posteriori estimation

## Machine Learning
Notebooks with done exercises on many ML and Data topics, using scikit-learn: 
- Data exploration
- Classification
- Clustering
- Association rules
- My written exam

## Deep Learning
My exam of deep learning. The task was to repair the order of words in shuffled sentences with a score based on a intersection over union metric.
Implemented with a transformer architecture using keras.
